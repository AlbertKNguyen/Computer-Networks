Skelton code from: https://github.com/UCMAndesLab/CSE160-Project-Skeleton-Code

Implemented the Node.nc and NodeC.nc files. You may edit the main function in either TestSim.py or pingTest.py to test the code. Must have TinyOS installed and ensure the path to the TinyOS root directory in the Makefile is correct.
Use the command "make micaz sim" to compile and "python "python filename"" to run the code.
